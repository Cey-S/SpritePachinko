âœ¨ A simple Pachinko game, where:  
- The spawn manager spawns coins in random positions at a fixed rate,  
- UI handler counts the coins that reach chests,  
- The ones that fall beneath the ground return to the object pool,
- Chest sprites change when a coin lands.  

ðŸŒ± In this project:
- I studied and implemented Observer Design Pattern,
- Studied and implemented Object Pooling,
- Created sprites by using the Shapes2D extension asset from Unity Store.
